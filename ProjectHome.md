Discrete lattice networks are used to model fracture in disordered materials. The most expensive part of such simulations using large three-dimensional networks involves solving  linear systems of equations. Here, we present a parallel multigrid
preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve these linear systems.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm performs significantly
better than the algorithms previously used to solve this problem.
